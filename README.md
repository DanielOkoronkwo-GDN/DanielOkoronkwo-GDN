ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dan â€” an iOS developer with over 6 years of experience building B2C apps that people use every day. I believe learning is evolution, and nothing fuels growth like a good challenge.

At [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk), Iâ€™m working on both of its iOS apps: [Feast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/guardian-feast-cook-explore/id6468674686) and [The Guardian Live](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287).

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m spending time with my family, writing at [The App Daily](https://theappdaily.com), practicing amateur martial arts, and exploring the world of sound engineering.
